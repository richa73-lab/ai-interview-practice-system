🧭 FIRST: HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROJECT

Your project has 4 BIG AI PARTS (not UI):

Knowledge grounding (PDF → knowledge)

Interview-style questioning (LLM)

Answer evaluation (LLM reasoning)

Speech & confidence analysis (later)

👉 You should build & understand these in isolation first, then connect them.

🪜 MASTER PLAN (DO THIS IN ORDER)
🔹 PHASE 0 – Foundations (VERY IMPORTANT)
What you must understand conceptually (no coding yet):

What an LLM can do

What RAG is and why fine-tuning is NOT needed

Why prompt engineering > fine-tuning for your case

🎯 Outcome:

You should be able to explain your project logic on paper.

🔹 PHASE 1 – LLM WITHOUT FINE-TUNING (Start Here)
⚠️ Important truth:

You do NOT need fine-tuning for interview questions.

Fine-tuning:

Needs GPU

Needs data

Not required for MVP

Interviewers will NOT expect it

You will use:
✅ Instruction-following LLMs + prompts

🧠 Free LLM Options (NO GPU)
1️⃣ OpenAI / similar API (Free tier / credits)

Best reasoning

Zero setup

Used for:

Question generation

Answer evaluation

Feedback

2️⃣ Hugging Face Inference API (FREE models)

No GPU needed

Call models via API

Good for experimentation

3️⃣ Colab (for local models)

Free GPU sometimes

Enough for:

Embeddings

Small LLMs

Audio processing

👉 You will NOT run big models locally.

🔹 PHASE 2 – RAG (THIS IS THE CORE OF YOUR PROJECT)

This is where your project becomes legit AI.

What RAG means in YOUR project:

“The AI should ask questions ONLY from what the student studied.”

RAG components (learn one by one):

PDF → text

Text → chunks

Chunks → embeddings

Store in vector DB

Retrieve relevant content

Inject into LLM prompt

🎯 No GPU required
🎯 Can run on Colab CPU

🔹 PHASE 3 – Interviewer Behavior (PROMPT ENGINEERING)

This is more important than fine-tuning.

You will design prompts like:

Act like an interviewer

Ask follow-ups

Increase difficulty

Handle “I don’t know”

This is:
✔ Pure thinking
✔ Pure design
✔ Very impressive in viva

🔹 PHASE 4 – Answer Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge)

You don’t “check answers” using rules.
You ask another LLM to evaluate.

Evaluation criteria:

Correctness

Depth

Clarity

Confidence (text-based first)

No GPU. Just smart prompts.

🔹 PHASE 5 – Voice & Confidence (LAST)

Only after text version works.

Voice pipeline:

Speech → text (Whisper on Colab)

Pause detection

Speed analysis

Hesitation words

This can be:

Colab

Free CPU

📚 WHERE TO START LEARNING (ORDER MATTERS)
WEEK 1 (Conceptual)

What is LLM

What is RAG

Prompt engineering basics

WEEK 2 (Hands-on AI)

Call an LLM API

Generate interview questions

Evaluate text answers

WEEK 3 (RAG)

PDF → embeddings

Retrieval

Context-aware questioning

WEEK 4 (Integration)

Simple UI

End-to-end flow

🚫 DO NOT DO THESE (FOR NOW)

❌ Fine-tuning
❌ Training models
❌ React
❌ Microservices
❌ GPU panic

🧠 How to Answer If Examiner Asks:

“Why didn’t you fine-tune?”

You say:

“Because interview questions depend on context, not memorization.
RAG ensures grounding, and prompt engineering ensures interviewer behavior.”

🔥 That answer alone is GOLD.

🟢 Final Question (ONE ONLY)

Before I guide further, tell me:

👉 Is this for final-year project, hackathon, or personal learning?

Your answer will decide how deep we go next.
